    "## Exercise: Descriptive Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will investigate and examine data from the stock market, focusing on technology stock, such as Apple for example. In this exercise, we'll use the `pandas`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib` libraries, and will cover concepts like expectance, rolling mean, and visualization of the data. We will learn how to utilize `yfinance` to obtain stock information and visualize various aspects of the data with Seaborn and Matplotlib.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be answering the following questions along the way:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.) What was the change in price of the stock over time?\\\n",
    "2.) What was the daily return of the stock on average?\\\n",
    "3.) What was the moving average of the various stocks?\n",

    "The initial step involves acquiring the data and loading it into memory. We will obtain our stock information from the Yahoo Finance website, which is a valuable source of financial market data and provides tools for discovering attractive investments. To extract data from Yahoo Finance, we will employ the `yfinance` library, which presents a threaded and Python-friendly approach for downloading market data."
